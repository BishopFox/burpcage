# burpcage-js

While Burp Suite plans to introduce JavaScript in its extender API, there is no documentation and it seems that Burp will not successfully load `.js` extensions.

This repo is getting ready for that transition. It will allow developers to create extensions in TypeScript and use webpack to create a single `.js` file.
